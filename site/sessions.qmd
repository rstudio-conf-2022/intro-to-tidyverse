First, make sure you've registered for this workshop through the [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) website. 

Once you've registered, you'll be ready to select a group session time that works for you! Plan to attend these sessions each week starting July 5th, 2022, and concluding the week of August 16th. Note that group sessions will not take place during the week of July 25th, during the conference, nor the following week of August 1st, which will be a break week.

If you can only attend a session that is listed as full, please email desiree@rstudio.com.
