Could you make a scatterplot of the two variables using ggplot2?\nYou have two datasets, one with information on music genres and age ranges, the other with genres and radio station call names. Can you imagine how you would join them together with a dplyr verb?\nWe want to model the wages of people in the United States, using their height and education as predictors. Then, we would like to plot model predictions for each level of educational attainment. Can you imagine how to do this in R?\n\nIf you answered “no” to any/all of those questions… great! This Academy experience is for you. By the end of the 6 weeks, you should be able to accomplish all those tasks. If you answered “yes” to all three questions, you may want to consider taking a different workshop."
