For content authors:

All slides (including PDF and static slides) are stored here in the `slides/` directory. If you are working with R Markdown slides, you can build your slides with the usual Knit button or Cmd + Shift + K.

R Markdown slides should all share the same folders: `libs/`, `assets/`, `images/`, `data/` and `data-raw/`. Use slide-specific sub-directories in these top-level folders, e.g. `session01-review.Rmd` might use `images/session01-review/` or `data/session01-review/`.
