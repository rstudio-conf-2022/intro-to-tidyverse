Welcome to today's session on recoding variables with `if_else()` and `case_when()`, two functions from the dplyr package. Let's get started.

---

class: middle

# Agenda

1. Review `dplyr::mutate()`
1. Recode with `dplyr::if_else()`
1. Recode with `dplyr::case_when()`
1. Work time: milestone recreation

???

Here's our agenda for this session. You’ve previously learned how to create and modify variables with `mutate()`. In this lesson, you’ll extend this skill by learning several new functions to use inside of `mutate()` to recode a variable based on its existing values.

We'll practice:

* Recoding data using two logical conditions with `if_else()`
* Recoding a variable using multiple conditions with `case_when()`

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to complete your milestone recreation using the hotels dataset. 

---
class: your-turn

# Review #1
Complete this code.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# mutate() review
# TODO: Need dataset for mutate() practice problems
```

???

Let's begin with some review.

---

# `patients` dataset

```{r}
patients
```
???

Today we'll work with the `patients` dataset. We have information about age, sex, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose level (mg/dL), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) for 30 patients. 

Imagine you are tasked with preparing the patient data for use in a program that only accepts the variable `sex` when formatted as 0s (for male) or 1s (for female). Let's see about doing that.

---
class: your-turn

# Your turn #1

Complete the code to create a column called `sex_recode`, recoding `male` as `0` and `female` as `1`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
patients %>% 
  mutate(
    sex_recode = ____(sex == "male", true = 0, false = 1)
  )
```


???

You can complete that task by using `if_else()` to recode the variable `sex`.

Think about how `mutate()` will affect your dataset. Will this code modify the column `sex`?

---
class: your-turn

# Your turn #1

Complete the code to create a column called `sex_recode`, recoding `male` as `0` and `female` as `1`.

```{r}
patients %>% 
  mutate(
    sex_recode = if_else(sex == "male", true = 0, false = 1)
  )
```


???

The call to `mutate()` did not alter the `sex` column; it created a new column called `sex_recode`.

---

# Using `if_else()`

```{r eval = FALSE}
patients %>% 
  mutate(
    sex_recode = if_else(sex == "male", 0, 1)
  )
```

???

`if_else()` takes three arguments to recode its values:

1. The first argument is a logical test to apply to each element of a vector.
1. The second argument is a value to output if the result of the logical test is TRUE.
1. The third argument is a value to output if the result of the logical test is FALSE.

You can explicitly write out `true =` or `false =` for the second and third arguments, but it is more common to see these `if_else()` arguments unlabelled.

---

class: your-turn

# Your turn #2

**Recode the values of systolic blood pressure (`sys_bp`) into two new categories: `"high"` and `"normal"`. Save the result as a new variable named `sys_status`.**

Consider a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or above to be “high” and a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mmHg to be “normal”.

```{r eval = FALSE}
patients %>% 
  mutate(____)
```


---

# Debug `if_else()`


---

# Complex logical conditions

We want to identify which patients require medical intervention based on their age, weight, and blood glucose level. Patients eligible for intervention must meet three criteria:

1. Age 40 or older
1. Blood glucose is 126 mg/dL or greater
1. A BMI of 30 or greater

---

class: your-turn

# Your turn #3

**Add a variable named `intervene` which takes the value `“yes”` for patients who meet the following criteria, and `"no"` for all others.** Save the result as a new tibble called `patients_interventions`.

1. Age 40 or older
1. Blood glucose is 126 mg/dL or greater
1. A BMI of 30 or greater

```{r eval = FALSE}
patients_interventions <-
  patients %>% 
  mutate(
    ____ = ____(
      ____ & ____ & ____, 
      "yes", 
      "no"
    )
```

---

# Complex TRUE and FALSE conditions

Consider the `patients_interventions` dataset you created in a previous exercise. Imagine that you predict the medical intervention will lower a patient’s BMI by 10% (i.e., `bmi * 0.90`), and you want to add these predicted values as a new variable.

---

class: your-turn

# Your turn #4

**Create a new variable called `bmi_predict` that calculates a 10% reduction in BMI for patients who receive intervention. For all other patients, have `bmi_predict` display the patient’s current BMI.**

```{r eval = FALSE}
patients_interventions %>% 
  ____
```

# Takeaway

Use this template to recode values with `if_else()`

# Multiple conditions

# `case_when()`


---
class: your-turn

# Your turn #5

Use `case_when()` to recode a variable.

```{r}

```

# Your turn #6

```{r}

# Debug `case_when()`

# Catch-all conditions

# Your turn #7

Practice using catch-all conditions inside of `case_when()`

```{r}

# Recoding to `NA`


---

# Your turn #8

Use `case_when()` to recode with `NA`s.

# Takeaway

Use this template to recode values with `case_when()`.
