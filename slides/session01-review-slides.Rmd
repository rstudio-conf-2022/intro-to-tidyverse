# Goals


???

Welcome to _Introduction to the Tidyverse_. This is the first in-person component we're including in an RStudio Academy course, and we're excited to pilot this with you all to allow for more group work, exposure to new project and datasets, and increased access to mentors and instructors. For the next two days, our goals are to:

1. Drill old wrangling skills and explore new ones

1. Learn best practices for exploring your data and report it reproducibly -- including doing this in your local RStudio IDE, outside of Academy.

In short, we're using these two days to give you sanctioned time to dive deep into the skills you've been learning the past few weeks with a lot of protected time for practice. 

[Will we build in opps for more learning and drilling during downtime?]

But there's an entire team of people behind the work and content that you're seeing today. Here are some of their faces. You'll be hearing from them as speakers today, some of them are your mentors, and of course, there are a whole host of other folks who couldn't be at the conference with us today, but whose fingerprints are all over the lessons and tech that have made the Academy experience you're going through possible.

What we'll do:

I'm going to give you a few prompts and/or recreations, and you'll work with your group to recreate these. 

You'll do your work in the R Markdown document you have open so you have a record of your code. You can create as many code chunks as you like in here.

# Review game rules

* For each prompt, the __first group with 4 or more people to have the answer correct__ (as verified by your mentor), scores a point.

--

* You must have the __correct code__ *and* the __correct output__.

--

* __Working together__ with your groupmates is encouraged.

--

* After 1-2 minutes, we'll go over the answer together. And then move on to the next question. 

--

* Group with the most points at the end wins

???

After the conference, you'll be able to see these slides (with all the prompts) linked on our website.

# .big-text[`outbreaks`]

???

...spread by contact with environmental sources or infected people or animals. I'll refer to this dataset as `outbreaks`. It comes from the CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).

First things first, let's take a look a what's in this dataset. 

So *here* is your first prompt:

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 1

Read in the data and explore it. Can you recreate output that looks like this?

```{r read-in-outbreaks, include = FALSE}
outbreaks <- readr::read_csv("data/session01/outbreaks.csv")
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
glimpse(outbreaks)
#str(outbreaks)
```
]

???

1 minute to read in the data and run `glimpse()`

---

## Solution 1
.pull-left[
```{r sol-1, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

outbreaks <- 
  read_csv("data/outbreaks.csv")

glimpse(outbreaks)
```
]

.pull-right.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
glimpse(outbreaks)
```
]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 2

What is the* **earliest year** on record in this dataset? **The latest**? 

Answer the questions by creating two tables that are sorted.

---

## Solution 2

.pull-left[
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(year)
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(desc(year))
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(desc(year)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
]
]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 3

The `state` variable appears to include US locations -- is the data limited to the 50 states? 

Produce a table that displays all the unique values of this variable.


---

## Solution 3

```{r sol-3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  distinct(state)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
outbreaks %>%
  distinct(state) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 4

What are the different etiologies that have been recorded in this dataset, and how often do they appear in the data? Display your results in a table like the one below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---

## Solution 4

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 5

Let's turn our attention to only observations where the primary mode of infection is Food. Using that criterion, can you reproduce the table below?

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

???

---

## Solution 5

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 6

.pull-left[
Explore the relationship between `month` and the number of illnesses with a series of **boxplots** like the one to the right. Can you recreate it? 
]

.pull-right[
```{r sol-6, echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month)) #<<
```
]


???

Check documentation for use of the argument that allows you to create a new boxplot for each grouping.

---

## Solution 6

.wide-left[
```{r ref.label = "sol-6", fig.show = "hide"}
```
]

.narrow-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-6", echo = FALSE}
```
]

???

But outlier here makes it hard to see what's going on. Let's modify this.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 7

Which observation in `outbreaks` is the outlier associated with such a high number of illnesses? 

  * Display solely this observation in a table. 

  * Then, recreate the boxplots **without** this observation.

---
class: space-saver

## Solution 7

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses == max(illnesses))
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses == max(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

<br>

]

--

.pull-left[
```{r sol-7-fig, fig.asp = 1/2, fig.show = "hide"}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses != max(illnesses)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label= "sol-7-fig", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 3/5}

```

]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 8

Which outbreaks lead to the highest number of illnesses? Display these observations in a table from greatest to fewest illnesses.

---
class: space-saver

## Solution 8

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 9

How many different primary modes of illness are in this dataset? How often does each appear in the data?

Order the rows so that the most common primary mode appears at the top. 

---

## Solution 9

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

???

Looks like the most common primary moe for outbreaks in this particular dataset is person-to-person.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 10

.pull-left[Can you figure out how to recreate this visualization of the **primary modes** of infection?]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = primary_mode)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() 
```
]

???

---

## Solution 10

.pull-left[
```{r sol-10, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-10", echo = FALSE}

```
]

???

Notice coord_flip()

If your first inclination was to use count() then you might have come up with an answer like...

---

## Solution 10 - alternative

.wide-left[
```{r sol-10-alt, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode, name = "count") %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode, y = count)) + 
  geom_col() + #<<
  coord_flip()
```
]

.narrow-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-10-alt", echo = FALSE}

```
]

???

This one, but it's a little less efficient code-wise.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 11 

Let's take a closer look at outbreaks associated with **Animal Contact**. 

* Which *individual* states have had the most Animal Contact outbreaks -- how many has each state had? 

* Create a table that contains the answer to both of these questions.  


---

## Solution 11

One possible solution:

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Animal Contact") %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(state != "Multistate") %>%  #<<

Now that we know the top 3 states are **Ohio**, **Minnesota**, and **Idaho**, recreate this table:

* Has only the Animal Contact outbreaks for those locations  

* Column names with "animal" appear after `state`

* Drop the `primary_mode` column

# Your Turn 17

Find **food borne** outbreaks that resulted in at least 1 **death**. Display the results in a table that contains only the columns from `year` to `deaths`.

---

## Solution

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(
    primary_mode == "Food", 
    deaths >= 1
  ) %>% 
  select(year:deaths)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}

    primary_mode == "Food", 
    deaths >= 1
  ) %>% 
  select(year:deaths) %>% 
  reactable_preview()

# Your Turn 18

Calculate new variable for each outbreak: **`fatality_rate`** (the  number of deaths / the number of illnesses, multiplied by 100). Then visualize the distribution of the fatality rate with a histogram.

---

## Solution 18
.pull-left[
```{r sol-18, fig.show = "hide", message = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  select(1:3, deaths, illnesses) %>% 
  mutate(
    fatality_rate = deaths / illnesses * 100
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
]

.pull-right[

```{r ref.label = "sol-18", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

# Your Turn 19

* Remove outbreaks that have a fatality rate of zero. 

* What is the distribution of the fatality rate for the remaining outbreaks as shown by a **notched boxplot**?

* Make the interior of your notched boxplot solid .blue[blue].

---

## Solution 19

.pull-left[
```{r sol-19, fig.show = "hide"}
outbreaks %>% 
  select(1:3, deaths, illnesses) %>% 
  mutate(
    fatality_rate = deaths / illnesses * 100
  ) %>%
  filter(fatality_rate > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    notch = TRUE,
    fill = "blue"

# Your Turn 20 - last one!

Find Washington DC's worst outbreak as defined by its **`hospitalization_rate`** (which you will need to calculate).

* Subset the data so you display observations that are at least 60% greater than DC's mean hopsitalization rate. 

* Your answer should be a tibble with the highest hospitalization rates shown at the top. 

* Any ties should be broken by outbreaks that happened more recently.

## Solution 20

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(state == "Washington DC") %>% 
  mutate(hospitalization_rate = hospitalizations / illnesses * 100) %>%
  filter(hospitalization_rate >= 1.60 * mean(hospitalization_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(hospitalization_rate), desc(year))
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(state == "Washington DC") %>% 
  mutate(hospitalization_rate = hospitalizations / illnesses * 100) %>%
  filter(hospitalization_rate >= 1.60 * mean(hospitalization_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(hospitalization_rate), desc(year)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
