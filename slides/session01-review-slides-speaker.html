So now, with those procedural things out of the way, let me officially welcome you to the conf component of the Introduction to the [NEXT] Tidyverse! 

This is the first time that we're including an in-person piece within an RStudio Academy course, and we're so excited that we get to pilot this with each one of you.

# The `tidyverse`

At Academy, we believe that learning any new skill (whether its musical, computational, athletic -- *any new skill*) is not simply about memorizing new facts...

By being here the next two days, you are checking off all of these boxes in some form. And you happen to be doing this for a skillset that is both highly valuable and versatile. 

You can take your coding and data science skills with you to any job 
-- apply them to goals both professional and personal.

So, by immersing yourself in the content and collaboration the next two days, you're really making a *long-term investment* in yourself.

# Goals

???

For the next two days, our goals are to support you in this by allowing for more group work, exposure to new projects and datasets, and increased access to mentors and instructors. Specifically...[CLICK]

1. Drill old wrangling skills and explore new ones [CLICK]

1. Learn best practices for exploring your data and reporting it reproducibly -- both in the Academy platform, but also in your local RStudio IDE.

In short, we hope the next two days allow you to do a deep-dive into the skills you've been learning the past few weeks, to apply new skills you'll learn, and take advantage of a lot of protected time for practice.

You'll be hearing from some as speakers; some of them are your mentors; and of course..

there are some who are not at the the workshop, but whose fingerprints are all over the lessons and tech that are making your Academy experience possible.

Each session, you'll be seated at the same table with your group. If there is group-presenting involved during the session, then you'll sign on to zoom using the link you usually use for group sessions. 

But turn your audio and camera off. The only thing necessary is screensharing, which your mentor will have you do as normal when it's time.

For other forms of code sharing as well as announcements, we can continue to use slack.

* You should place a green sticky on your laptop if you‚Äôre done with an exercise and a pink sticky if you want help. [CLICK]

* You can use pink stickies at anytime during the session to signal that you're stuck, lost, or would like help.

Go ahead and open up the milestone for this Session 1.

## üöÄ Rapid fire review 


&lt;img src="images/session01/your-turn-example.png" width="577" /&gt;

???

What we'll do:

I'm going to give you a prompt with a short tidyverse task, and you'll work to recreate it. 

You'll do your work in the R Markdown document you have open so you have a record of your code. You can create as many new code chunks as you like in here. 


---

# Review challenge rules

* For each prompt, the __first group with 4 or more people to have the answer correct__ (as verified by your mentor), scores a point.

--

* You must have the __correct code__ *and* the __correct output__.

--

* __Working together__ with your groupmates is encouraged.

--

* After 1-2 minutes, we'll go over the answer together. And then move on to the next question. 

--

* Group with the most points at the end wins (a small prize!)

???

For each prompt, the first group with 4 or more people to have the correct answer, scores a point.

You must have the correct code and output.

Working together is okay (and encouraged)

We'll go over the answer once I see that most groups have finished.

There are 20 prompts -- we may get through all of them (or not). But there will be a prize for the winning group at the end. 

I should also note that there's a bit of a mish mash of difficulty. But The main idea is that you exercise some tidyverse recall and get warmed up.


After today, I'll share the slides with the prompts and the solutions so that you'll be able to refer back to them later.

Check documentation for use of the argument that allows you to create a new boxplot for each grouping.

# Your Turn 9

How many different primary modes of illness are in this dataset? How often does each appear in the data?

Order the rows so that the most common primary mode appears at the top.

## Solution 9


```r
outbreaks %&gt;%
  count(primary_mode) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

???

Looks like the most common primary moe for outbreaks in this particular dataset is person-to-person.

Notice coord_flip()

If your first inclination was to use count() then you might have come up with an answer like...

## Solution 10 - alternative

.wide-left[

```r
outbreaks %&gt;%
* count(primary_mode, name = "count") %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode, y = count)) +

???

This one, but it's a little less efficient code-wise.

Let's take a closer look at outbreaks associated with **Animal Contact**. 

* Which *individual* states have had the most Animal Contact outbreaks -- how many has each state had? 

* Create a table to answer these questions.

## Solution 11

One possible solution:


```r
outbreaks %&gt;%
  filter(primary_mode == "Animal Contact") %&gt;% 
  count(state) %&gt;% 
* filter(state != "Multistate") %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(n))

Now that we know the top 3 states are **Ohio**, **Minnesota**, and **Idaho**, recreate this table:

* Has only the Animal Contact outbreaks for those locations  

* Column names with "animal" appear after `state`

* Drop the `primary_mode` column

# Your Turn 18

Calculate new variable for each outbreak: **`fatality_rate`** (the  number of deaths / the number of illnesses, multiplied by 100). 

Then visualize the distribution of the fatality rate with a histogram.

---

## Solution 18
.pull-left[

```r
outbreaks %&gt;% 
  select(1:3, deaths, illnesses) %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    fatality_rate = deaths / illnesses * 100
  ) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 7154 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

# Your Turn 19

* Remove outbreaks that have a fatality rate of zero. 

* What is the distribution of the fatality rate for the remaining outbreaks as shown by a **notched boxplot**?

* Make the interior of your notched boxplot solid .blue[blue].

---

## Solution 19

.pull-left[

```r
outbreaks %&gt;% 
  select(1:3, deaths, illnesses) %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    fatality_rate = deaths / illnesses * 100
  ) %&gt;%
  filter(fatality_rate &gt; 0) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = fatality_rate)) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    notch = TRUE,
    fill = "blue"

# Your Turn 20 - last one!

Find Washington DC's worst outbreak as defined by its **`hospitalization_rate`** (which you will need to calculate).

* Subset the data so you display observations that are at least 60% greater than DC's mean hopsitalization rate. 

* Your answer should be a tibble with the highest hospitalization rates shown at the top. 

* Any ties should be broken by outbreaks that happened more recently.



---

## Solution 20


```r
outbreaks %&gt;% 
  filter(state == "Washington DC") %&gt;% 
  mutate(hospitalization_rate = hospitalizations / illnesses * 100) %&gt;%
  filter(hospitalization_rate &gt;= 1.60 * mean(hospitalization_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(hospitalization_rate), desc(year))
```
